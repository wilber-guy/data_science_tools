    "\n",
    "If you got into Data-Science and Machine Learing because you thought most your day you would be working with AI and playing with friendly robots, I have bad news for you. That day is not here, yet. Most of your time is actually spent collecting good data, then \"cleaning\" that data so you can feed your models good features. In this notebook I will walk you through the steps required to get your data ready for machine learning."

    "4.  Work with catigorical data and create numerical represntations\n",
    "5.  Understand what insight you can extract from your data\n",
    "6.  Try to create new features that may generate insight for your model\n",
